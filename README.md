# Minimal AI Agents

A small collection of examples for building AI agents with the OpenAI API, using the Fireworks platform.

Current examples include:

- [Simple Chatbot](./examples/chatbot.py): A barebones agent that can chat with the user on a loop
- [Tool-Using Agent](./examples/tools.py): An agent that decides when a function call is needed, or when to respond directly to the user
- [RAG Agent](./examples/rag/rag-agent.py): An agent that uses a dataset of documents to answer user questions 
- [Image Comprehension](./examples/vision/explain.py): An agent that can analyze and explain the contents of an image
- [Image Generation](./examples/vision/generate.py): An agent that can generate images based on user prompts
