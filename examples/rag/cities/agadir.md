# Agadir
Located on the southern Atlantic coast of Morocco, Agadir is a modern city known for its wide beaches, sunny climate, and relaxed lifestyle. Rebuilt after a devastating earthquake in 1960, Agadir has become one of the country’s top destinations for beach holidays, water sports, and seaside resorts. Unlike the traditional medinas of the north, Agadir offers a more contemporary experience mixed with Berber culture and ocean vibes.
